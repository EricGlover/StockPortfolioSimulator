# Stock Portfolio Simulator App

## Description
A single-page web app where you can trade tech stocks from 2016 and build as impressive of a portfolio as you can imagine. There's a simple Express server that handles scrubbing all the Quandl API stock data but all the functionality comes from the React app. Besides React the front-end also uses Redux and Material-UI. All the date logic is handled with Moment.js (thank the heavens for Moment.js).
