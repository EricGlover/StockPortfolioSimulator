# Stock Portfolio Simulator App

## Description
A single-page web app where you can trade stocks tech stocks from 2016 and build as impressive of a portfolio as you can imagine. There's an simple Express server that handles scrubbing all the Quandl API stock data but all the functionality comes from the React app. All the date logic is handled with Moment.js (thank the heavens for Moment.js).
